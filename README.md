# WebFormexample
Webform Project with jsonpowerDB connectivity
The code uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap to create the form, which includes input fields for employee ID, name, and email. The code also includes a script with a saveEmployee() function, which is used to validate the form data and send a PUT request to an API. This request includes the form data as a JSON string, and can be used to update the employee's information in the database.
